## Editors & IDEs

Editors and IDEs are listed below in alphabetical order.



### Eclipse

[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is an industrial-strength Java-based IDE.

See our [Eclipse tutorial](../tutorials/eclipse.html) for more info.



### Emacs

[GNU/Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) is a full-featured
programmable editor.

See our [Emacs tutorial](../tutorials/emacs.html) to get started.



### jEdit

[jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/) is an easy-to-use GUI text editor written in Java.
Although it comes out of the box with some Clojure support, you'll need to
install the [LispIndent](https://github.com/odyssomay/LispIndent) plug-in to get
good indentation support.

The easiest way this author has found to install jEdit is to just download and
run the Java-based installer (jar file). After that, follow the excellent
instructions in the LispIndent README.

Two configuration recommendations for after you've installed LispIndent: In
"Plugins --> Plugin Options --> LispIndent pane":

  * in the "File Ending Options" area, make sure the box is checked so that
    this plug-in is used only for clj/cljs files, and
  * to set up LispIndent specifically for *Clojure*, click the "Use Preset"
    button and select "Clojure" in the pop-up.



### Vim

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is an efficient and full-featured text editor.

See our [Vim tutorial](../tutorials/vim_fireplace.html) for more info.
