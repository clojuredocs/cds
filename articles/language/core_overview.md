## About this guide

This guide covers:

 * Key functions of `clojure.core`
 * Key macros of `clojure.core`
 * Key vars of `clojure.core`
 * Essential special forms

This guide is **by no means comprehensive** and does not try to explain each function/macro/form in depth. It is an overview,
the goal is to briefly explain the purpose of each item and provide links to other articles with more information.

## Fundamentals

### let

(let ...) allows binding of locals and defines an explicit scope for those bindings. The bindings are defined as a vector of [symbol value] pairs.

The body of a (let ...) statement also provides an implicit (do ...) that allows for multiple statements in the body of (let ...).

A basic example:
{% highlight clojure %}
(let [x 1 y 2] (println x y)) ;; 1 2
{% endhighlight %}

Let can be nested, and the scope is lexically determined. This means that a binding's value is determined by the nearest binding form for that symbol.

This example basically demonstrates the lexical scoping of the let form.
{% highlight clojure %}
(let [x 1]
  (println x) ;; prints 1
  (let [x 2]
    (println x))) ;; prints 2
{% endhighlight %}

Let bindings are immutable and can be destructured.

{% highlight clojure %}
todo - link to destructuring
{% endhighlight %}

### def

(def ...) takes a symbol and an optional init value. If an init value is supplied, the root binding of the var is assigned to that value. Redefining a var with an init value will re-assign the root binding. 

A root binding is a value that is shared across all threads.

The (let ...) form is the preferred method of creating local bindings. It is strongly suggested to prefer it where possible, and never use (def ...) within another form.


{% highlight clojure %}
;; todo - reference to var documentation, basic example
;; todo - metadata
{% endhighlight %}

### declare

(declare ...) provides a simple way of creating 'forward declarations'. (declare ...) defs the supplied symbols with no init values. This allows for referencing of a var before it has been supplied a value.

There are much better methods of value-based dispatch or code architecture in general, but this presents a simple situation forward declarations would be necessary.

{% highlight clojure %}
(declare func<10 func<20)

;; without declare you will receive an error similar to:
;; "Unable to resolve symbol: func10 in this context"

(defn func<10 [x]
  (cond
   (< x 10) (func10 (inc x))
   (< x 20) (func20 x)
   :else "too far!"))

(defn func<20 [x]
  (cond
   (< x 10) (func10 x)
   (< x 20) "More than 10, less than 20"
   :else "too far!"))
{% endhighlight %}

No matter which order you put func<10 and func<20 in, there will be a reference to a var that does not yet exist when the compiler does the initial evaluation of top-level forms.

(declare ...) defines the var with no binding so that the the var exists when it is referenced later in the code.

### defn

(defn ...) allows for succinct definition of a function and metadata about its argslist and doc-string. (defn ...) inherently allows for quick documentation of functions that can be retrieved with (doc ..). This feature should be used almost universally.

Without (defn ..), a var would be directly bound to a function definition and explicit metadata about the doc string and argslits would be added manually.

{% highlight clojure %}
(def func (fn [x] x))

;; same as:
(defn func [x] x)

;; with metadata added by defn
(def ^{:doc "documentation!"} ^{:arglists '([x])} func (fn [x] x))

;;same as
(defn func "documentation!" [x] x)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight clojure %}
;; todo - link to doc and metadata
{% endhighlight %}

### ns

### if

(if ...) is the primary method of conditional execution and other conditionals are built upon (if ...).

(if ...) is an expression that takes 2 expressions, and an optional third.  If the return value of the first expression is anything except nil or false, the second expression is evaluated and the result returned..

If a third expression is provided, when the first expression returns nil or false the third expression is evaluated and returned.


{% highlight clojure %}
user=> (if 0 "second") ;; 0 is a 'true' value. Only false or nil are 'false'
"second"

user=> (if nil "second" "third")
"third"

user=> (if (< 10 9) "second" "third") ;; (< 9 10) returns false
"third"

user=> (if (seq '()) "second") ;; seq returns nil for an empty sequence
nil

user=> (if (nil? (= 1 2)) "second" "third") ;; differentiate between nil and false if needed
"third"
{% endhighlight %}

### when

(when ...) provides an implicit do form that is evaluated if an expression returns true, otherwise nil is returned. When does not provide an 'else'.

{% highlight clojure %}
user=> (when (= 1 2) (print "hey") 10)
nil

user=> (when (< 10 11) (print "hey") 10)
hey
10
{% endhighlight %}

### for

(for ...) allows for list comprehensions. (for ...) takes a vector of pairs of [binding collection]. (for ...) then assigns each sequential value in the collection to the binding form and evaluates them rightmost first. The results are returned in a lazy sequence.

(for ...) allows for explicit let, when and while through use of ":let []" ":when (expression)" ":while (expression)" in the binding vector.

{% highlight clojure %}
(for [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]] 
  [x y])
  
;; ([1 4] [1 5] [1 6] [2 4] [2 5] [2 6] [3 4] [3 5] [3 6])
{% endhighlight %}

:when only evaluates the body when a true value is returned by the expression provided

{% highlight clojure %}
(for [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]
      :when (and
             (even? x)
             (odd? y))]
  [x y])
  
;; ([2 5])
{% endhighlight %}

:while evaluates the body until a non-true value is reached. Note that the rightmost collection is fully bound to y before a non-true value of (< x 2) is reached. This demonstrates the order of the comprehension.

{% highlight clojure %}
(for [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]
      :while (< x 2)]
  [x y])
  
;; ([1 4] [1 5] [1 6])
{% endhighlight %}

### doseq

(doseq ...) is similar to (for ...) except it does not return a sequence of results. (doseq ...) is generally intended for execution of side-effects in the body, and thusly returns nil.

(doseq ...) supports the same bindings as for - :let :when :while. For examples of these, see for.

{% highlight clojure %}
(doseq [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]]
  (println [x y]))
  
;; [1 4][1 5][1 6][2 4][2 5][2 6][3 4][3 5][3 6]
;; nil
{% endhighlight %}

### apply

(apply ...) effectively unrolls the supplied args and a collection into a list of arguments to the supplied function.

{% highlight clojure %}
(str ["Hel" "lo"])
"[\"Hel\" \"lo\"]" ;; not what we want, str is operating on the vector

user> (apply str ["Hel" "lo"]) ;; same as (str "Hel" "lo")
"Hello"
{% endhighlight %}

(apply ...) prepends any supplied arguments to the form as well.

{% highlight clojure %}
(map + [[1 2 3] [1 2 3]]) ;; This attempts to add 2 vectors with +
;; ClassCastException   java.lang.Class.cast (Class.java:2990)

(apply map + [[1 2 3] [1 2 3]]) ;; same as (map + [1 2 3] [1 2 3])
;; (2 4 6)

(apply + 1 2 3 [4 5 6]) ;; same as  (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6)
;; 21
{% endhighlight %}

Note that apply can not be used with macros.

## Sequences

### count

Returns a count of the number of items in a collection. Nil returns a value of 0.

{% highlight clojure %}
(count "Hello")
;; 5

(count [1 2 3 4 5 6 7])
;; 7
{% endhighlight %}

Note that count does not return in constant time for all collections. This can be determined with (counted? ...). Lazy sequences must be realized to get a count of the items.

{% highlight clojure %}
(counted? "Hello")
;; false

(counted? (range 10) ;; will be fully realized when using (count (range 10))
;; false

(counted? [1 2 3 4 5]) ;; Constant time return of (count)
;; true 
{% endhighlight %}
