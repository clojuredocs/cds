## What Version of Clojure Does This Guide Cover?

This guide covers Clojure 1.4.



## Some Options

Below are some of the various options available for web development
with Clojure, listed roughly by size.



### Ring and Compojure

Perhaps the simplest and most minimal setup is to use only Ring and
Compojure. To get started, see the [basic web development
tutorial](/articles/tutorials/basic_web_development.html).



### lib-noir

In addition to Ring and Compojure, you might also make use of
[lib-noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir).



### Luminus

[Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/) is [a lein
template](https://github.com/yogthos/luminus-template) for creating
batteries-included web applications. It makes use of Ring, Compojure,
lib-noir, and optionally (as described in its documentation) other
libraries.
