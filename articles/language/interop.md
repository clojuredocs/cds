## What Version of Clojure Does This Guide Cover?

This guide covers Clojure 1.4.


## Overview

Clojure was designed to be a hosted language that directly interoperates with its host platform (JVM, CLR and so on).
Clojure code is compiled to JVM bytecode. For method calls on Java objects, Clojure compiler
will try to emit the same bytecode `javac` would produce.

It is possible to implement interfaces, extend and generate Java classes in Clojure.

Clojure also provides convenient functions and macros that make consuming of Java libraries
easier and often more concise than it would be in Java code.


## Imports

Java classes can be referenced either using their fully-qualified names (FQNs) such as
`java.util.Date` or be *imported* in the current Clojure namespace using `clojure.core/import` and
referenced by short names:

``` clojure
java.util.Date ;= java.util.Date
```

``` clojure
(import java.util.Date)

Date ;= java.util.Date
```

`ns` macro supports imports, too:
``` clojure
(ns myservice.main
  (:import java.util.Date))
```

More about the `ns` macro can be found in the article on [Clojure namespaces](/articles/language/namespaces.html).

Dynamic (at runtime) imports are usually only used in the REPL and cases when there are multiple implementations of a particular
protocol/service/feature and it is not possible to tell which one should be used until run time.

### Inner (Nested) Classes

In Java, classes can be nested inside other classes. They are called *inner classes* and by convention,
separated from their outer class by a dollar sign (`$`):

``` clojure
(import java.util.Map$Entry)

Map$Entry ;= java.util.Map$Entry

;; this example assumes RabbitMQ Java client is on classpath
(import com.rabbitmq.client.AMQP$BasicProperties)

AMQP$BasicProperties ;= com.rabbitmq.client.AMQP$BasicProperties
```

Note that if you need to use both a class and one or more of its inner classes, they all need to be imported separately.
As far as JVM is concerned, they are all separate classes, there is no "imports hierarchy".


## How to Instantiate Java Classes

Java classes are instantiated using the `new` special form:

``` clojure
(new java.util.Date) ;= #inst "2012-10-09T21:23:57.278-00:00"
```

However, Clojure reader provides a bit of syntactic sugar and you are much more likely
to see it used:

``` clojure
(java.util.Date.)    ;= #inst "2012-10-09T21:24:43.878-00:00"
```

It is possible to use fully qualified names (e.g. `java.util.Date`) or short names with imports:

``` clojure
(import java.util.Date)

(Date.) ;= #inst "2012-10-09T21:24:27.229-00:00"
```

An example with constructor arguments:

``` clojure
(java.net.URI. "http://clojure.org") ;= #<URI http://clojure.org>
```

## How to Invoke Java Methods

### Instance Methods

Instance methods are invoked using the `.` special form:

``` clojure
(let [d (java.util.Date.)]
  (. d getTime)) ;= 1349819873183
```

Just like with object instantiation, it is much more common to see an alternative version:

``` clojure
(let [d (java.util.Date.)]
  (.getTime d)) ;= 1349819873183
```


### Static Methods

Static methods can be invoked with the same `.` special form:

``` clojure
(. Math floor 5.677) ;= 5.0
```

or (typically) to sugared version, `ClassName/methodName`:

``` clojure
(Math/floor 5.677) ;= 5.0

(Boolean/valueOf "false") ;= false
(Boolean/valueOf "true")  ;= true
```


### Chained Calls

It is possible to chain method calls using the `..` special form:

``` clojure
(.. (java.util.Date.) getTime toString) ;= "1349821993809"
```


### Multiple Calls

If you need to call a bunch of side-effecting methods on one object, you
can use the `doto` macro:

``` clojure
(doto (java.util.Stack.) (.push 42) (.push 13) (.push 7)) ;= #<Stack [42, 13, 7]>
```

Notice that this macro returns it's first argument as a result.


## How to Access Java Fields

Public mutable fields are not common in Java libraries but sometimes you need to access them.
It's done with the same dot special form:

``` clojure
(import java.awt.Point)

(let [pt (Point. 0 10)]
  (. pt x)) ;= 0

(let [pt (Point. 0 10)]
  (. pt y)) ;= 10
```

and just like with instance methods, it is much more common to see the following version:

``` clojure
(import java.awt.Point)

(let [pt (Point. 0 10)]
  (.x pt)) ;= 0

(let [pt (Point. 0 10)]
  (.y pt)) ;= 10
```


## How to Set Java Fields

To set a public mutable field, use `clojure.core/set!` that takes a field in the dot notation
demonstrated earlier and a new value:

``` clojure
(import java.awt.Point)

(let [pt (Point. 0 10)]
  (set! (.y pt) 100)
  (.y pt)) ;= 100
```

Fortunately, mutable public fields are rare to meet in the JVM ecosystem so you won't need
to do this often.


## How To Work With Enums

[Enums (enumeration) type](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html) values are accessed
the same way as fields, except on enum classes and not objects:

``` clojure
java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit/MILLISECONDS ;= #< MILLISECONDS>
```


## Determining Classes of Java Objects

To get class of a particular value, pass it to `clojure.core/class`:

``` clojure
(class 1)      ;= java.lang.Long
(class 1.0)    ;= java.lang.Double
(class "docs") ;= java.lang.String
(class (java.net.URI. "http://github.com")) ;= java.net.URI
```

As this example demonstrates, Clojure strings are JVM strings, integer literals are compiled
as longs and floating point literals are compiled as doubles.


## How To Get a Java Class Reference By Name

To obtain a class reference by its string name (fully qualified), use `Class/forName` via Java interop:

``` clojure
(Class/forName "java.util.Date") ;= java.util.Date
```

### Array Types, Primitives

JVM has what is called **primitive types** (numerics, chars, booleans) that are not "real" objects.
In addition, array types have pretty obscure internal names. If you need to obtain a reference to
an array of longs, for example, pass `"[[J"` to `Class/forName`. Below is the full table:

<table class="table-striped table-bordered table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Internal JVM class name</th>
      <th>Array of ? (type)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[S"</td>
      <td>short</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[I"</td>
      <td>integer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[J"</td>
      <td>long</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[F"</td>
      <td>float</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[D"</td>
      <td>double</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[B"</td>
      <td>byte</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[C"</td>
      <td>char</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"[[Z"</td>
      <td>boolean</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If this does not make much sense, don't worry. Just remember to come
back to this guide when you need to extend a protocol for an array of
primitives.

## Implementing Java Interfaces With reify

It is possible to implement Java interfaces in Clojure. It is
typically needed to interact with Java libraries that take arguments
implementing a particular interface.

Interfaces are implemented using the `reify` special form.

Given the following Java interface:

``` java
public
interface FilenameFilter {
    /**
     * Tests if a specified file should be included in a file list.
     *
     * @param   dir    the directory in which the file was found.
     * @param   name   the name of the file.
     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the name should be
     * included in the file list; <code>false</code> otherwise.
     */
    boolean accept(File dir, String name);
}
```

here is how to implement it in Clojure:

``` clojure
;; a FileFilter implementation that accepts everything
(reify java.io.FilenameFilter
  (accept [this dir name]
    true))
```

`reify` takes an interface (fully-qualified name or short name) and one or more
method implementations that mimic function definitions without the `defn` and with
*this* (as in Java, JavaScript or *self* in Ruby, Python) reference being the first argument:

``` clojure
(accept [this dir name]
  true)
```

With `reify`, generally there is no need to add type hints on arguments: Clojure
compiler typically will detect the best matching method (by name and number of arguments).

`reify` returns a *Java class instance*. Clojure compiler will generate a class that implements
the interface and instantiate it. To demonstrate that reified objects indeed implement
the interface:

``` clojure
(let [ff (reify java.io.FilenameFilter
           (accept [this dir name]
             true))]
  (instance? java.io.FileFilter ff)) ;= true
```

### Example 1

The following example demonstrates how instances created with `reify` are passed around
as regular Java objects:

``` clojure
(import java.io.File)

;; a file filter implementation that keeps only .clj files
(let [ff (reify java.io.FilenameFilter
           (accept [this dir name]
             (.endsWith name ".clj")))
    dir  (File. "/Users/antares/Development/ClojureWerkz/neocons.git/")]
  (into [] (.listFiles dir ff))) ;= [#<File /Users/antares/Development/ClojureWerkz/neocons.git/project.clj>]
```


### Clojure Functions Implement Runnable and Callable

Note that Clojure functions implement `java.lang.Runnable` and
`java.util.concurrent.Callable` directly so you can pass functions to
various classes in `java.util.concurrent`, for example.
