## Overview

Clojure is a wonderfully simple language and you are going to love
it.

To quickly get started, first make sure you've got Java installed.

Then install the [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) project management
tool. Clojure programs are typically developed inside their own
project directory, and Leiningen manages
projects for you. Lein takes care of pulling in dependencies (including Clojure itself),
running the REPL, running your program and its tests, packaging your program for
distribution, and other administrative tasks.


## Trying out the REPL

Although lein facilitates managing your projects, you can also run it
on its own (outside of any particular project directory). Once you
have the `lein` tool installed, run it from anywhere you like to get a
repl:

    $ lein repl

You should be greeted with a "`user=>`" prompt. Try it out:

``` clojure
user=> (+ 1 1)
; 2
user=> (distinct [:a :b :a :c :a :d])
; (:a :b :c :d)
user=> (dotimes [i 3]
  #_=>   (println (rand-nth ["Fabulous!" "Marvelous!" "Inconceivable!"])
  #_=>            i))
; Marvelous! 0
; Fabulous! 1
; Inconceivable! 2
; nil
```


## Your first project

Create your first Clojure program like so:

``` bash
lein new app my-proj
cd my-proj
# Have a look at the "-main" function in src/my_proj/core.clj.
lein run
```

and see the output from that `println` function call in
my_proj/core.clj!


## Interactive Development

In your project directory, start up a repl (`lein repl`) and
run your `-main` function to see its output in the repl:

    $ lein repl
    ...
    my-proj.core=> (-main)
    Hello, World!
    nil

(The prompt is now "my-proj.core=>" instead of "user=>" because lein
has started the repl in an app project. More about that ("namespaces")
in the topical guides.)

From elsewhere, open up your my-proj/src/my_proj/core.clj file
in your editor. Modify the text in that `println` call.

Back in the repl, reload your source file and run `-main` again:

    my-proj.core=> (require 'my-proj.core :reload)
    my-proj.core=> (-main)

to see your changes.
